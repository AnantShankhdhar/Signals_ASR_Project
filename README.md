## Project Overview ##
* We plan on building a Machine Learning Based Voice Analytics tool. The toolkit Designed for multiple forms of analysis from audio data intended to help understand the speaker and their behaviour for optimizing business functions etc.

* We will design the toolkit to be able to perform various forms of analysis on both live audio recorded as well as a stream of audio files stored in a folder, this can be easily used in a web application.

* The application will consist of two main modules:-
  * Extracting text from audio using automatic speech recognition(ASR)
